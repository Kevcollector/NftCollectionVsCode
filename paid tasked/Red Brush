- check gen 1 holders , rarity holders (we have no. of rarity to show you)
- calculated total  benefits of gen 1 holder from all sales in a week its 5% all sales of gen 2 by point system
- check gen 2 holders , rarity holders (rariry show on title)
- calculated  total benefits of gen 2 holder from all sales in a week  its 10% all sales of gen 2 by point system

And both need a calculation of rewards of 
5% gen 2 sales and resales for gen 1 
10% gen 2 sales and resales for gen 2
